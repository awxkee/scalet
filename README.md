# scalet

`scalet` is a **Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT)** library written in Rust, focused on
speed, numerical robustness, and high-quality visualization.

It provides fast CWT execution for `f32` and `f64`, multiple wavelet types, flexible scale generation,
and optional **color scaleogram rendering** with perceptually good colormaps (including Turbo).
